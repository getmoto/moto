PR Checklist
================================

Ready to open a new PR? Great. Please have a quick look at this checklist to make sure that you're ready:

 - [ ] Feature is added
 - [ ] The linter is happy
 - [ ] Tests are added
 - [ ] All tests pass, existing and new

Can't quite get it working? :raw-html:`<br />`
Create the PR anyway! Seeing the code can help others figure out what's wrong.

Halfway through and too busy to finish? :raw-html:`<br />`
Create the PR anyway! Others can use your work and build on it to finish the feature.

.. note::  You can indicate a PR that's not quite ready with the `needs-help`-label.

Are you not sure on what you want to implement, or want some advice on how to approach things?
Feel free to open a new issue on Github: https://github.com/getmoto/moto/issues
