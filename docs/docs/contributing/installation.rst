Development Installation
=============================

This is a guide how to install Moto for contributors.

The following software is assumed to be present:

 - Python 3.x
 - Docker
 - Git


Checking out the code
======================
Contributing to Moto involves forking the project.
GitHub has a handy guide explaining how to do this: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects

Installing Moto locally
========================

It is recommended to work from some kind of virtual environment, i.e. `virtualenv`, to prevent cross-contamination with other projects.
From within such a virtualenv, run the following command to install all required dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

  make init

With all dependencies installed, run the following command to run all the tests and verify your environment is ready:

.. code-block:: bash

  make test

Note that this may take awhile - there are many services, and each service will have a boatload of tests.

You can also run the linting checks separately:

.. code-block:: bash

  make lint

To verify all tests pass for a specific service, for example for `s3`, run these commands manually:

.. code-block:: bash

  ruff moto/s3 tests/test_s3
  black --check moto/s3 tests/test_s3
  pylint moto/s3 tests/test_s3
  mypy
  pytest -sv tests/test_s3

If black fails, you can run the following command to automatically format the offending files:

.. code-block:: bash

  make format

If any of these steps fail, please see our :ref:`contributing faq` or open an issue on Github.

Development within a Devcontainer
==================================

Moto is equipped with a `devcontainer.json` for use in VSCode Devcontainers and/or GitHub Codespaces.

Launching the Devcontainer or Codespace:

 - Configures Docker-in-Docker.
 - Sets up a Virtual Environment in `${workspaceFolder}/.venv`.
 - Runs `make init`.

Be patient while the Devcontainer or Codespace launches as dependencies automatically installed. 

Once both `postCreateCommand` and `postStartCommand` have run, open a Terminal session in VSCode and run:

.. code-block:: bash

  source .venv/bin/activate

Then standard development on Moto can proceed, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

  ruff moto/s3 tests/test_s3
  black --check moto/s3 tests/test_s3
  pylint moto/s3 tests/test_s3
  mypy
  pytest -sv tests/test_s3
