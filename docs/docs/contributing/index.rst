=============================

Want to contribute to Moto? Yes please! The aim is to mock as many services and features as possible.
With AWS releasing new services almost daily, that is for sure a moving target! So any help is welcome.

Check our :ref:`contributing installation` guide on how to install Moto locally.
The :ref:`contributing architecture` page can be useful or interesting if you want to dive deeper in Moto's guts, but feel free to skip this page if you're not interested.

Want to add some new features, or improving the behaviour of existing ones? :ref:`contributing feature` is for you.

We also have a collection of :ref:`contributing tips` to give some guidance.

Finally, the :ref:`contributing faq` page may have some questions to your burning answers that popped up while reading this saga.
