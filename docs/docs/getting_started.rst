Getting Started with Moto
=========================

Installing Moto
---------------

You can use ``pip`` to install the latest released version of ``moto``, and specify which service(s) you will use::

    pip install 'moto[ec2,s3,..]'

This will install Moto, and the dependencies required for that specific service.

If you don't care about the number of dependencies, or if you want to mock many AWS services::

    pip install 'moto[all]'

If you want to install ``moto`` from source::

    git clone git://github.com/getmoto/moto.git
    cd moto
    pip install '.[all]'


Moto usage
----------

For example, we have the following code we want to test:

.. sourcecode:: python

    import boto3

    class MyModel:
        def __init__(self, name, value):
            self.name = name
            self.value = value

        def save(self):
            s3 = boto3.client("s3", region_name="us-east-1")
            s3.put_object(Bucket="mybucket", Key=self.name, Body=self.value)

There are several ways to verify that the value will be persisted successfully.

Decorator
~~~~~~~~~

With a decorator wrapping, all the calls to S3 are automatically mocked out.

.. sourcecode:: python

    import boto3
    from moto import mock_s3
    from mymodule import MyModel

    @mock_s3
    def test_my_model_save():
        conn = boto3.resource("s3", region_name="us-east-1")
        # We need to create the bucket since this is all in Moto's 'virtual' AWS account
        conn.create_bucket(Bucket="mybucket")

        model_instance = MyModel("steve", "is awesome")
        model_instance.save()

        body = conn.Object("mybucket", "steve").get()[
            "Body"].read().decode("utf-8")

        assert body == "is awesome"

Context manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Same as the Decorator, every call inside the ``with`` statement is mocked out.

.. sourcecode:: python

    def test_my_model_save():
        with mock_s3():
            conn = boto3.resource("s3", region_name="us-east-1")
            conn.create_bucket(Bucket="mybucket")

            model_instance = MyModel("steve", "is awesome")
            model_instance.save()

            body = conn.Object("mybucket", "steve").get()[
                "Body"].read().decode("utf-8")

            assert body == "is awesome"

Raw
~~~

You can also start and stop the mocking manually.

.. sourcecode:: python

    def test_my_model_save():
        mock = mock_s3()
        mock.start()

        conn = boto3.resource("s3", region_name="us-east-1")
        conn.create_bucket(Bucket="mybucket")

        model_instance = MyModel("steve", "is awesome")
        model_instance.save()

        body = conn.Object("mybucket", "steve").get()[
            "Body"].read().decode("utf-8")

        assert body == "is awesome"

        mock.stop()

Unittest usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use `unittest`_ to run tests, and you want to use `moto` inside `setUp`, you can do it with `.start()` and `.stop()` like:

.. sourcecode:: python

    import unittest
    from moto import mock_s3
    import boto3

    def func_to_test(bucket_name, key, content):
        s3 = boto3.resource("s3")
        object = s3.Object(bucket_name, key)
        object.put(Body=content)

    class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):

        bucket_name = "test-bucket"
        def setUp(self):
            self.mock_s3 = mock_s3()
            self.mock_s3.start()

            # you can use boto3.client("s3") if you prefer
            s3 = boto3.resource("s3")
            bucket = s3.Bucket(self.bucket_name)
            bucket.create()

        def tearDown(self):
            self.mock_s3.stop()

        def test(self):
            content = b"abc"
            key = "/path/to/obj"

            # run the file which uploads to S3
            func_to_test(self.bucket_name, key, content)

            # check the file was uploaded as expected
            s3 = boto3.resource("s3")
            object = s3.Object(self.bucket_name, key)
            actual = object.get()["Body"].read()
            self.assertEqual(actual, content)

Class Decorator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to use decorators on the class-level.

The decorator is effective for every test-method inside your class. State is not shared across test-methods.

.. sourcecode:: python

    @mock_s3
    class TestMockClassLevel(unittest.TestCase):
        def setUp(self):
            s3 = boto3.client("s3", region_name="us-east-1")
            s3.create_bucket(Bucket="mybucket")

        def test_creating_a_bucket(self):
            # 'mybucket', created in setUp, is accessible in this test
            # Other clients can be created at will

            s3 = boto3.client("s3", region_name="us-east-1")
            s3.create_bucket(Bucket="bucket_inside")

        def test_accessing_a_bucket(self):
            # The state has been reset before this method has started
            # 'mybucket' is recreated as part of the setUp-method
            # 'bucket_inside' however, created inside the other test, no longer exists
            pass

.. note:: A tearDown-method can be used to destroy any buckets/state, but because state is automatically destroyed before a test-method start, this is not strictly necessary.

Stand-alone server mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Moto also comes with a stand-alone server allowing you to mock out an AWS HTTP endpoint. For testing purposes, it's extremely useful even if you don't use Python.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ moto_server -p3000
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:3000/

However, this method isn't encouraged if you're using ``boto3``, the best solution would be to use a decorator method.
See :doc:`server_mode` for more information.

Recommended Usage
-----------------
There are some important caveats to be aware of when using moto:

How do I avoid tests from mutating my real infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You need to ensure that the mocks are actually in place.

 #. Ensure that your tests have dummy environment variables set up:

    .. sourcecode:: bash

        export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='testing'
        export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='testing'
        export AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN='testing'
        export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN='testing'
        export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION='us-east-1'

 #. Do no embed credentials directly in your code. This is always considered bad practice, regardless of whether you use Moto. It also makes it impossible to configure fake credentials for testing purposes.


 #. **VERY IMPORTANT**: ensure that you have your mocks set up *BEFORE* your `boto3` client is established.
    This can typically happen if you import a module that has a `boto3` client instantiated outside of a function.
    See :ref:`pesky_imports_section` below on how to work around this.

.. note:: By default, the region must be one supported by AWS, see :ref:`Can I mock the default AWS region?` for how to change this.

Example on usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you are a user of `pytest`_, you can leverage `pytest fixtures`_ to help set up your mocks and other AWS resources that you would need.

Here is an example:

.. sourcecode:: python

    @pytest.fixture(scope="function")
    def aws_credentials():
        """Mocked AWS Credentials for moto."""
        os.environ["AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"] = "testing"
        os.environ["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"] = "testing"
        os.environ["AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN"] = "testing"
        os.environ["AWS_SESSION_TOKEN"] = "testing"
        os.environ["AWS_DEFAULT_REGION"] = "us-east-1"

    @pytest.fixture(scope="function")
    def s3(aws_credentials):
        with mock_s3():
            yield boto3.client("s3", region_name="us-east-1")

    @pytest.fixture
    def create_bucket1(s3):
        boto3.client("s3").create_bucket(Bucket="b1")

    @pytest.fixture
    def create_bucket2(s3):
        boto3.client("s3").create_bucket(Bucket="b2")

    def test_s3_directly(s3):
        s3.create_bucket(Bucket="somebucket")

        result = s3.list_buckets()
        assert len(result["Buckets"]) == 1

    def test_bucket_creation(create_bucket1, create_bucket2):
        buckets = boto3.client("s3").list_buckets()["Buckets"]
        assert len(result["Buckets"]) == 2


In the code sample above, all of the AWS/mocked fixtures take in a parameter of `aws_credentials`,
which sets the proper fake environment variables. The fake environment variables are used so that `botocore` doesn't try to locate real
credentials on your system.

With Moto activated within the fixture, we can pass it to a test-method to ensure that any other AWS-calls are also mocked inside that test method.
We can also combine multiple fixtures that use the same Moto-fixture.

Moto will delete any data after the mock ends, so the state is not shared across methods.


.. _pesky_imports_section:

What about those pesky imports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As mentioned earlier, mocks should be established __BEFORE__ the clients are set up.

Some background on why this is necessary:  :raw-html:`<br />`
Moto intercepts HTTP requests using a custom event handler that hooks into botocore's event-system.  :raw-html:`<br />`
When creating clients/resources, `boto3` gathers all event handlers that have been registered at that point, and injects those handlers into the created client/resource. Event handlers registered after a client is created, are not used.

The `moto.core`-package registers our event handler on initialization. So to be pedantic: `moto.core` should be imported before a client is created, in order for `boto3` to call our custom handler and therefore for Moto to be active.  :raw-html:`<br />`
The easiest way to ensure this happens, is to establish a mock before the clients are setup, as `moto.core` is imported when the mock starts.


One way to avoid import issues is to make use of local Python imports -- i.e. import the module that creates boto3-clients inside of the unit test you want to run.

Example:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def test_something(s3):
        # s3 is a fixture defined above that yields a boto3 s3 client.
        
        from some.package.that.does.something.with.s3 import some_func # <-- Local import for unit test
        # ^^ Importing here ensures that the mock has been established.

        some_func()  # The mock has been established from the "s3" pytest fixture, so this function that uses
                     # a package-level S3 client will properly use the mock and not reach out to AWS.

Patching the client or resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If it is not possible to rearrange imports, we can patch the boto3-client or resource after the mock has started. See the following code sample:

.. sourcecode:: python

    # The client can come from an import, an __init__-file, wherever..
    outside_client = boto3.client("s3")
    s3 = boto3.resource("s3")

    @mock_s3
    def test_mock_works_with_client_or_resource_created_outside():
        from moto.core import patch_client, patch_resource
        patch_client(outside_client)
        patch_resource(s3)

        assert outside_client.list_buckets()["Buckets"] == []

        assert list(s3.buckets.all()) == []

This will ensure that the boto3 requests are still mocked.

Other caveats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For Tox, Travis CI, Github Actions, and other build systems, you might need to also create fake AWS credentials. The following command will create the required file with some bogus-credentials:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    mkdir ~/.aws && touch ~/.aws/credentials && echo -e "[default]\naws_access_key_id = test\naws_secret_access_key = test" > ~/.aws/credentials
